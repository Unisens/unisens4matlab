# unisens4matlab

unisens4matlab is a Matlab toolbox for the Unisens data format. It makes use of the [unisens4java library](https://github.com/Unisens/unisens4java).

Unisens is a **universal data format for multi sensor data**. It was developed at the [FZI Research Center for Information Technology](http://www.fzi.de/en/about-us/organisation/research-divisions/ess-embedded-systems-and-sensors-engineering/) and the [Institute for Information Processing Technology (ITIV)](http://www.itiv.kit.edu) at the University of Karlsruhe. The motivation for specifying a new data format was the need for a universal, generic and sustainable format for storing and archiving sensor data from various recording systems. Other main requirements were a human readable header and the use of future-proof standards.
