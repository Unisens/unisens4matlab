# Unisens 4 Matlab

Unisens is a **universal data format for multi sensor data**. It was developed at the [FZI Research Center for Information Technology](http://www.fzi.de/ess) and the
[Institute for Information Processing Technology (ITIV)](http://www.itiv.kit.edu) at the University of Karlsruhe. The motivation for specifying a
new data format was the need for a universal and generic format for recording and archiving sensor data from various recording systems.

While developing Unisens 2.0, the following [features](features.php) were put into consideration:

*   The data format needed to handle signals from different sensors with different sampling rates. Recording of events like a QRS annotation for ECG data sets should be also needed to be made possible.
*   Unisens needed to be capable of archiving data files. The context information could hence be preserved since there are various possibilities of adding comment on the
file and on the entries inside.
*   The Unisens header needed to be in a form that could easily to be read by the human eye. Different file types and  data types needed to be supported.

For more information please read the [feature list](features.php) and/or the
[documentation](documentation).
